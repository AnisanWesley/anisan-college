####Requisito: Conhecimento básico no programa Expert Sinta.

This is a expansion shell for [Expert Sinta](http://www.lia.ufc.br/~bezerra/exsinta/). [Download](ftp://ftp.lia.ufc.br/sinta/sinta.zip). 

Basically your goal is to read the files generated by the base of Expert Experience and translate everything into objects to make this available to the user of the class in **Metadata** format  as:
* Variables
* Values
* Rules
* Questions
* Conditions
* Logical to define a solution from base.
* Interface
	* Custom questions
	* Reasons for such questions
ow we have solutions name, authors and abstract
respectivamente
##Usibility

#### 1 - Create a instance of `Sistema` class.
Passing two-argument constructor that are files generated by ExSinta:
```csharp
var sistema = new Sistema("c:\\temp\\base.txt", "c:\\temp\\code.txt");
```

Now we have solutions name, authors and abstract with `solucao.Nome`, `solucao.Autores` and `solucao.Resumo` respectively and to all Metadata extraction from  ExSinta.

#### 2 -ask to system with  `sistema.Perguntar()` **(optional)**
This method will return the next question to make, this is::
* `Variavel` - Variable related to that question
* `Descrição` - Question's description
* `Motivo` - reason for question

If you do not inform reason or description of the question in the ExSinta's interface, it will generated with default values​​


#### 3 - Answer to system with `sistema.Responder(params string)`
Answer the system with short strings depending on the type of question.

**E.g.:** `sistema.Responder("sim","s","n","alternative a","alternative c","no","yes")`. 
Each parameter will answer the corresponding question the order that the rules are selected.

But is recommended ever call `sistema.Perguntar()` to know what are responding, because the order of selected rules is volatile.

`Responder()` can accept that types of values depending (or not) from the next question:
* **True/False:** for boolean questions, only write `S` for positive answers and other char for negative answers
* **Predefined values**: Must answer exactly as the selected option.
	*	Exemplo: `What type of motherboard beeps that produces the boot?` Options: `shot`,`long` and `both`. In this case `Both` or `both` are valid answers
* **Access the reason of question:** can be made in two ways:
	*	Adding a question mark to answer. E.g: `sistema.Responder("reason?")`,`sistema.Responder("why?")`.
	*	Accessing `sistema.Perguntar().Motivo`, since it returns an object of type `Pergunta`
* **Advanced Commands:** Typing `:`and then one of these commands:
  *  `:variaveis` -  return all variables
  *  `:valores` - return all values
  *  `:regras` - return all rules
  *  `:perguntas` - return all questions
  *  `:condicoes` - return all conditions grouped by rules
  *  `:help` - return the help text

**Note:** Nothing is case-sensitive, `'reason' == 'reASoN'`

##Auxiliary Methods
* `GetRegrasRegeitadas()`
* `GetRegrasAtivas()`
* `GetCondicoesByRegra(int ruleCode)`

##Contribuing

**This project was made for a college homework, so just solved my problem and some classmates, works with quite a lot but still has some bugs with diverse metadata it is not enough generic.
Keep up the will to make a Fork and help make this Expansion Shell even more complete..**
####Known Limitations ( a.k.a. Pending Implementations)

* Values ​​and variables should have different names throughout the system
	* E.g. Don't `cat.race` and `dog.race` but `cat.cat_race` and `dog.dog_race`
* not assign values ​​to `yes` and `not` leave blank, as if boolean, the system already handles this
* Condition does not support `OR`
* Confidence factor should always be `100%`
* only `univaloraed` variables 
* Names of values​​, variables can not be `uppercase '
* Only terms of equality, yet don't makes `<>`
* Values​​, questions, solutions should not contain the following characters `,`, `,`, `" `.
* Metadata must be contains only one objective.
